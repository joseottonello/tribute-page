            About him
          </h3>
          William Henry Gates III better known as Bill Gates, born in the city of Seattle, Washington state on
          October 28, 1955 is an American businessman, computer scientist, and philanthropist, known for having created and
          founded together with Paul Allen, the Microsoft company. He in the same way he is known to have created, also in
          in conjunction with Paul Allen, the operating system for Windows computers.
          He attended the elite Lakeside private school in Seattle, this school already had a computer in it.
          year 1968, which allowed Gates to make contact with the machine and become fond of computers. Also in Lakeside
          it's where he met paul allen
          On April 4, 1975, while still a student at Harvard University, he created the software company Microsoft.
          In 1976 he dropped out of college and moved to Albuquerque, at the MITS headquarters, to agree with that company the
          transfer of 50% of the language for Basic computers. The following year, he learned of the success of the Apple company
          and that they needed a Basic interpreter.
          His fortune is estimated at 96.6 billion dollars (2019) according to Forbes magazine, a fact that places him as
          the fourth richest man in the world.
          Before the dot.com2 bubble burst, his net worth was $ 114.1 billion,
          which made him the 10th richest person in all of human history.
          He is one of the best known entrepreneurs to emerge during the early days of personal computers. He has been
          criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive, an opinion that in some cases
          it has been upheld by numerous court rulings.5
          He was married to Melinda Gates, 1 with whom he shares the presidency of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, 
          dedicated to rebalance opportunities in health and education at the local level, although he has also participated
          in other countries. By For example, in Nigeria with the program to eradicate polio, which is why they have been awarded
          the Prize prince of Asturias of International Cooperation in 2006.
          In 1980, he met with IBM representatives in Seattle. They wanted to have the CP / M operating system. He
          I comment on the existence of an adapted version called QDOS or 86DOS, committing to obtain a license not
          exclusive in order to adapt it. With this, he managed to sell them the idea of ​​the MS-DOS operating system, without counting on it,
          buying the 86DOS at a very low price from young programmer Tim Paterson. IBM needed that operating system to
          compete with Apple, which is why the negotiation was flexible. Microsoft wanted the license rights,
          maintenance, and even the power to sell DOS to other companies. IBM accepted, considering that what
          would pay dividends would be the hardware and not the software. A few days later, Microsoft bought the rights to
          author of the QDOS to Tim Paterson, who worked for Seattle Computer Products, for $ 50,000, which he sold
          to IBM as MS-DOS (Microsoft DOS). What was strikingly striking was that IBM did not buy MS-DOS but rather
          decided to pay Microsoft a royalty for each copy sold together with an IBM-PC.
          Aware of the importance of the graphical environment that Apple had shown (originally the graphical interface and the
          "mouse" were developed by Xerox PARC) on his Lisa computer, he set out to get the graphical environment too
          and the "mouse" to operate it. Meanwhile, Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, began the development of the Macintosh, Bill Gates
          visited Apple. He offered to improve his spreadsheets and other programs. He threatened to sell his computer equipment to
          IBM, with which it obtained an Apple-Microsoft alliance. Microsoft legally obtained the technology of the
          graphics and mouse environment, and launched Microsoft Windows as a direct competitor to the Macintosh.
          Since the beginning of the century, the Microsoft Windows operating system (in all its versions) has been used in most
          part of the planet's personal computers.

          development of the company, continuing as Honorary President of the same. On June 27, 2008, he left his job at Microsoft, 
          handing over control of the company to Steve Ballmer. Bill Gates dedicates 70% of his time to the Bill and Melinda Gates

          previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.

          for Africa 4, a sold-out non-competitive tennis match to be played at Seattle's Key Arena. The event was held in 
          support of the charitable efforts of the Roger Federer Foundation in Africa. Federer and Gates played John Isner,
